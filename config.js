In the summer of 2020, many took to the streets to protest the high-profile police killings of Black individuals across the country and in Richmond. There was not a single incident that protesters were responding to but, rather centuries of racial violence and dispossession <i>arising from the connected policies and practices of Black Codes, Redlining, Urban Renewal, foreclosure and eviction</i>. Eviction is widely recognized as a problem but often treated in the same individualized way as racialized violence, divorcing it from its systemic and historical context, and therefore limiting understanding and potential to address it.',

            description: "Eviction is another problem that is widely recognized but often treated in the same individualized way, divorcing it from its systemic and historical context, and therefore limiting understanding and potential to address it. Much of the recent attention to eviction as a public policy concern can be traced to 2018 when the Princeton Eviction Lab released a comprehensive dataset of eviction rates down to the census block group level. While the statewide eviction rate was 5.12%, Richmond’s eviction rate over the 16 years studied was more than 11%, giving Richmond the second highest-rate of legal evictions in large cities in the country. Yet eviction is not distributed evenly across the city. In Richmond’s white west end, the rate was three percent or lower, while in some neighborhoods in Richmond’s northside, southside and east end, the rates were more than three times the citywide rate, meaning that more than a third of renters were evicted every year. When controlling for factors such as income, home value, and other factors, neighborhood racial composition was the strongest predictor of neighborhood eviction rates in Richmond.",

Newly freed people began to establish churches, homes, and businesses within the city. But this Reconstruction period ended by 1875. In 1902, Virginia ratified a new constitution. This constitution took away many of the freedoms granted to Black individuals during the Reconstruction period, including the right to vote and the ability of Black men to participate in politics. The Commonwealth also passed 'one-drop' rules defining who was Black. Although racialized zoning (determining who could live where based on race) was outlawed by the Supreme Court in 1917 <a href='https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/245/60/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>(Buchanan vs. Warley)</a>, the City of Richmond passed a law that you could not live in a neighborhood with someone you could not marry. Interracial marriage was banned in Virginia until 1967 <a href='https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/388/1/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>(Loving vs. Virginia)</a>.

            description: 'Urban Renewal was a federal program created during the new deal that was initially focused on the replacement of poor quality housing with new housing. However, along with the development of public housing and highways, Urban Renewal areas were determined on racial lines. Cities had to determine that a neighborhood or building was blighted to be part of Urban Renewal. However, blight definitions were both explicitly and implicitly based on race. Black residents in a neighborhood were part of many definitions of blight, but disinvestment - which was driven by racialized decisions - was another critical part of blight. In Richmond, Urban Renewal and highway projects flattened the Randolph, Fulton, Shockoe Bottom, Jackson Ward and Navy Hill communities - all of which were thriving Black neighborhoods.',

            description: 'Although eviction is often framed as ahistorical, it has deeper roots in racialized dispossession - or the taking of land and land value. In 1937 when the federal government began insuring mortgages to address foreclosure and, ultimately increase access to homeownership, the mortgage industry and the federal government created a racialized valuation of neighborhoods. Called Redlining, for the code given to Black and brown neighborhoods, the exclusion of these neighborhoods, combined with ongoing segregation of white neighborhoods effectively prevented nonwhite residents from obtaining a home loan. More importantly, because no one could buy in Black neighborhoods, homeowners lost value, which had a domino effect in the neighborhood as a whole.',

            description: 'In an interview conducted by Dr. Caroline Morris, Ida Ellett discussed growing up in the historic neighborhood of Fulton, Richmond. Coming from a large family, the Ellett’s originally lived in North Carolina on a sharecropper’s farm. When the family moved to Richmond, Ida’s mother worked in a tobacco factory. As a child, Ida lived and attended church in the Fulton area. She talks about growing up during the 30’s during the height of the Great Depression. <i>‘We didn’t know any different. We didn’t have anything and our friends didn’t have anything, there were a few of them and those who did have shared’</i>. She attended high school at Armstrong, the only Black high school in Richmond. During the war years of the 40’s she lived in D.C. working for the Census Bureau. Ida stayed in D.C. for 4 to five years before returning to Richmond.  She married Robert Ellett after moving back to Richmond and was married for 53 years.  For a short period, the married couple lived in Varina before moving back to Fulton, Richmond. Ida recalls paying the poll tax in order to vote in Richmond. Ida was also a campaigner for Oliver Hill and worked with the Richmond NAACP. In 1978, Ida went to VCU to complete a degree in Community Service.  When asked about the urban renewal of Fulton Ida stated: <i>‘Well you know I haven’t really thought about it a lot, you know I did feel you know it’s such a waste to tear down the way they did. Because when they started when they condemned and moved people out, it scattered them so, and I didn’t know where they were…’</i>',

The moratorium took effect in March of 2020 and was extended throughout the year into 2021. ',

            description: 'In an interview conducted by Dr. Caroline Morris, Evelyn Bowman speaks of her time in Fulton. Bowman was born and raised in Fulton, Richmond where she lived until 1971. She graduated high school in 1941 and attended Virginia Union until the start of the War. She was heavily involved with Mt. Zion Baptist Church and was part of the Fulton Improvement Association. The association worked hard to for structural change in the Fulton neighborhood. Bowman discusses the many black businesses located in Fulton. She also recalls working in the American Tobacco Factory during the summers to make extra money. When asked about the urban renewal of Fulton, Bowman stated: <i> Urban renewal, it didn’t come overnight. It was implemented.</i> She goes on to tell a story about how the Fulton Improvement Association and other members of the community would go to City Council meetings. Primarily in order to keep properties from being taken in the neighborhood. ',

            title: 'Reparative Planning as a Solution',
            description: 'In light of this history of harm that systematically targets Black people and other communities of color, reparative planning is focused on directly addressing the harms. It is both historically-informed and future-oriented practice. Where policy and public and private action have repeatedly and systematically prevented racialized communities from developing economic and political autonomy, reparative planning works to reverse those policies and actions and to build new modes of planning that ensure justice. As Rashad Williams explains, a reparative planning project requires attention to the material and symbolic bases that maldistribute resources and power, as well as dismantling intransigence against a reparative approach. A reparative planning approach must fundamentally rethink and reform how Black communities, and other racialized groups, participate—or more precisely how they have been “allowed” to participate—in setting planning goals and enacting policies. <br> Addressing the balance of power is something that ultimately lies at the core of planning, even if the field historically considered itself, if not completely apolitical, then squarely focused on a neutral expertise. Assuming some kind of political neutrality is futile because addressing matters of public concern are fundamentally about power. While planning cannot take on racial capitalism and white supremacy on its own, the field should certainly reassess its core values and what that would mean for a reparative planning future.',
